# Purpose
This document provides a follow-along example of:  

* Creating a pin on RStudio Connect 
* Retrieving a pin from RStudio Connect 
* Publishing content that uses a pin to RStudio Connect  

# Prework - Environment Variables
Prior to beginning, environment variables must be set in your development environment for pins to work. 

1. Create an API key from RStudio Connect: [Learn How](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/api-keys/)  
2. Create a `.Renviron` file in this directory to store the API key and RStudio Connect server address variables.

```
# Example .Renviron file contents

CONNECT_SERVER="<your-connect-server>"
CONNECT_API_KEY="<your-connect-api-key>"
```

# Creating a pin
Let's say we are running an important analysis that involves body temperature measurements of beavers. Let's look at our data first.  

```{r}
library(datasets)
head(beaver1)
```

Nice looking data!

Now we want to pin this data to RStudio Connect so it is also accessible to our colleagues for their important work and we don't have to email this around as a csv file.  Let's get started!

## Register the board

First, **register the board** so your session knows that it can place content on your Connect board:

```{r}
# Pins will use CONNECT_API_KEY and CONNECT_SERVER by default,
# but we are being explicit here anyway.
pins::board_register_rsconnect(
  key = Sys.getenv("CONNECT_API_KEY"), 
  server = Sys.getenv("CONNECT_SERVER")
)
```

After running the script above, did you see that the Connections pane in your RStudio IDE now shows the board `rsconnect`?  This gives you an easy way to browse your organization's pinned objects.  Here's what mine looks like:  
  
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '65%', out.extra = 'style="background-color: #447099; padding:5px;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/connections_pane.png")
```
  
## Pin the data
 
Now we want to **pin our data** to RStudio Connect. 

_Before you run this code chunk_: Update the `name = "mydata"` parameter to give your pin a unique name identifier on the server.

```{r}
pins::pin(beaver1, name = "mydata", description = "Beaver Body Temperature Measurements", board = "rsconnect")
```

Take a moment to switch to the RStudio Connect content dashboard and give yourself a pat on the back. **Your data is now pinned!**

## Visit your new pin

From the dashboard, you can adjust the user access permissions, add collaborators, and even give your pin a custom content URL.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%', out.extra = 'style="background-color: #447099; padding:5px;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pinned_to_connect.png")
```

# Retrieving a pin  
Now let's pretend you're a colleague and you want to access this data for your own analysis.  

Feel free to put on a hat if it helps you to get into character. Keep in mind that your colleague won't have access to your environment with your API key -- this is by design! We don't recommend you share API keys with other people. For someone else to retrieve your pin, two things need to happen:

1. **_You need_** to give them permission by adjusting the **Access Settings** on your Pin in the RStudio Connect content dashboard.
2. **_They need_** to generate an API key from their own RStudio Connect account, just like you did way back in the **Prework** section. 
  
Okay, if we imagine that all of those things have taken place, let's get the dataset from RStudio Connect. 

In RStudio Connect, did you notice the header information on your pin?  This is present on every pin published to Connect and it provides the code to retrieve your pin in either R or Python.  Handy, huh?  

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%', out.extra = 'style="background-color: #447099; padding:5px;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/retrieval_code.png")
```

So let's copy that code into our analysis and **retrieve the pin**. 

Replace the `# Retrieve Pin` code section below with the sample from your own pin:

```{r}
# Register RStudio Connect
library(pins)
pins::board_register_rsconnect(
  key = Sys.getenv("CONNECT_API_KEY"), 
  server = Sys.getenv("CONNECT_SERVER")
)

# Retrieve Pin
# beaver_data <- pin_get("your/pin", board = "rsconnect")
  
# View the pin locally
# head(beaver_data)
```

Jackpot! We have our data.

# Using pins in content 

So you think you're hot stuff and off and running?  For now, perhaps.  But let's say you want to publish something to RStudio Connect (like this RMD file), which creates or updates a pin. A good reason for this would be because you want to use Connect's scheduling feature to make an ETL (extract, transform, and load) process that keeps your pin up-to-date.  That way, downstream apps or analyses can point to this current pin and stay current and you don't have to re-deploy that app or analysis every time the data updates!  Now _that's_ working smart!

## Try publishing

Go ahead, try **publishing this document to your RStudio Connect server** right now. 

**If your server is configured to allow it, you shouldn't need to provide your `CONNECT_SERVER` and `CONNECT_API_KEY` environment variables again.** 

But if you see this error message:  

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%', out.extra = 'style="background-color: #447099; padding:5px;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/env_var_error.png")
```

Simply go to the RStudio Connect content settings panel, select the **Vars** option and create environment variables for `CONNECT_API_KEY` and `CONNECT_SERVER` - values will appear in plain text until you hit **Save**.

Click the **Refresh Report** button to re-render your document with the new environment variables in place.  Hold breath... and... 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%', out.extra = 'style="background-color: #447099; padding:5px;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/deploy_success.png")
```

VoilÃ !  Congratulations!  You're a pinning machine. **You've now deployed content that includes references to a pinned object.**. You're ready to incorporate pins as part of a more efficient workflow. Congratulations!
